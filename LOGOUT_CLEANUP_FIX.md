# Worker Data Isolation - Logout Cleanup Solution

## Problem
When multiple workers logged in using the same browser, they could see each other's verification logs. This was a **data privacy issue** where Worker A's logs remained visible to Worker B after Worker A logged out.

## Solution Approach
**Industry Standard: Clear data on logout** instead of using separate databases per user.

This is the preferred approach because:
- ✅ Simpler implementation (no database name management)
- ✅ Industry standard (Gmail, Facebook, Banking apps all use this)
- ✅ Better for shared devices (kiosks, public computers)
- ✅ Ensures complete data cleanup
- ✅ No orphaned databases accumulating

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `clearAllUserData()` - `packages/shared-auth/src/authService.ts`

**Added cleanup for:**
- `WorkerCache` IndexedDB database (verification logs)
- Historical stats localStorage (`historicalStats`)
- Historical logs settings (`historicalLogsDays`)
- Historical logs cache (`historicalLogs.cache`)
- Performance metrics (`vcMetrics:verificationMs`, `vcMetrics:storageMs`)

```typescript
export async function clearAllUserData() {
  // Clear localStorage tokens
  clearTokens();
  
  // Clear additional localStorage items
  try {
    localStorage.removeItem('deviceId');
    localStorage.removeItem('organization');
    localStorage.removeItem('organizationId');
    localStorage.removeItem('org_id');
    localStorage.removeItem('current_org_id');
    localStorage.removeItem('historicalStats');
    localStorage.removeItem('historicalLogsDays');
    localStorage.removeItem('historicalLogs.cache');
    localStorage.removeItem('vcMetrics:verificationMs');
    localStorage.removeItem('vcMetrics:storageMs');
  } catch {}
  
  // Clear IndexedDB databases
  try {
    await clearIndexedDB('WorkerCache');
    await clearIndexedDB('VCVerifierDB');
    await clearIndexedDB('VCVerifierCache');
    console.log('All user data cleared successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error clearing IndexedDB data:', error);
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced State Cleanup - `apps/worker-pwa/src/context/VCStorageContext.tsx`

**Added cleanup for:**
- Verification duration metrics
- Storage duration metrics
- All other state variables on logout

```typescript
if (!isAuthenticated) {
    // Clear all state when user logs out
    setStats({ ...EMPTY_STATS });
    setLogs([]);
    setDailyStats([]);
    setHistoricalStats([]);
    setVerificationDurations([]);
    setStorageDurations([]);
    return;
}
```

## How It Works

### Login Flow
1. Worker A logs in
2. Verification logs stored in `WorkerCache` IndexedDB
3. Stats and metrics stored in memory and localStorage

### Logout Flow
1. Worker A logs out
2. `clearAllUserData()` is called automatically (from `AuthContext.signOut()`)
3. **All data is completely wiped:**
   - IndexedDB databases deleted
   - localStorage items removed
   - React state cleared
4. Browser storage is now clean for the next user

### Next Login
1. Worker B logs in
2. Gets a fresh, empty database
3. Only sees their own verification logs
4. Complete data isolation achieved

## Backend Verification
The backend already correctly filters logs by `verified_by=user`:
- `server/backend/worker/views.py::get_worker_historical_logs()` (line 756)
- `server/backend/api/serializers.py::VerificationLogSerializer.create()` (lines 82-90)

## Industry Comparison

This approach follows the same pattern as:

| App | Approach |
|-----|----------|
| **Gmail** | Clears cache on logout |
| **Banking Apps** | Wipes all local data on logout |
| **Facebook** | Clears IndexedDB on logout |
| **Slack** | Deletes workspace data on logout |
| **WhatsApp Web** | Clears chat cache on logout |

## Security Benefits

1. **Complete Data Removal**: No residual data left behind
2. **Shared Device Safety**: Safe for use on public/shared computers
3. **Privacy Compliance**: Meets GDPR/privacy requirements
4. **Storage Management**: No accumulation of old databases
5. **Simple & Reliable**: Less complexity = fewer bugs

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Test Logout Cleanup:**
   ```javascript
   // Open DevTools Console
   // Before logout, check storage:
   indexedDB.databases() // Should show WorkerCache
   localStorage // Should have historicalStats, etc.
   
   // After logout:
   indexedDB.databases() // WorkerCache should be gone
   localStorage // Should be cleaned
   ```

2. **Test Multi-User:**
   - Log in as Worker A
   - Create verification logs
   - Log out
   - Log in as Worker B
   - Verify Worker B sees empty logs (not Worker A's data)

3. **Test Data Persistence:**
   - Log in as Worker A
   - Create logs
   - Refresh the page (should persist)
   - Log out
   - Log back in as Worker A
   - Should start with empty logs (fresh session)

## Migration Notes

- Existing logged-in users will have their data cleared on next logout
- No migration script needed
- Seamless transition for users

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### ❌ User-Specific Database Names
- Pros: Data persists across sessions
- Cons: Accumulates orphaned databases, complex cleanup, not standard practice

### ✅ Clear on Logout (Chosen)
- Pros: Industry standard, simple, secure, no orphaned data
- Cons: User must re-fetch historical logs on login (acceptable tradeoff)

## Conclusion

This solution provides **industry-standard data isolation** through complete cleanup on logout, ensuring each worker only sees their own data while keeping the implementation simple and maintainable.
