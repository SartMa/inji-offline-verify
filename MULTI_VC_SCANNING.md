# Multi-VC Scanning Feature

## Overview
The QR Scanner Modal now supports scanning multiple Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in sequence, displaying them in a photo gallery-like interface at the bottom of the scanner.

## Features

### üîÑ Continuous Scanning
- Scanner remains open after each successful scan
- No need to restart the scanner for each QR code
- Error handling keeps scanner active for retry attempts

### üì∏ Photo Gallery Display
- Scanned VCs appear as numbered thumbnails at the bottom
- Color-coded borders indicate verification status:
  - **Green**: Valid credential
  - **Orange/Yellow**: Valid but expired credential  
  - **Red**: Invalid credential
- Status icons overlay on each thumbnail for quick identification

### üîç Interactive Review
- Click any thumbnail to view detailed verification results
- Popup shows the same detailed information as single scans
- "Continue Scanning" button returns to scanner view

### üìä Progress Tracking
- Badge in title shows total number of scanned VCs
- Counter displays current scan count
- "Done" button appears when VCs are scanned

## User Flow

1. **Start Scanning**: Click "Start Scanning" to activate camera
2. **Scan QR Code**: Position QR code in camera view
3. **View Result**: Verification popup appears automatically
4. **Continue**: Click "Continue Scanning" to keep scanner open
5. **Review Previous**: Click thumbnails to review previous scans
6. **Complete**: Click "Done" or close modal to finish

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
interface ScannedVC {
  id: string;
  timestamp: number;
  result: VerificationResult;
  credential?: any;
}

const [scannedVCs, setScannedVCs] = useState<ScannedVC[]>([]);
const [selectedVCForView, setSelectedVCForView] = useState<VerificationResult | null>(null);
```

### Key Changes
- Scanner stays active between scans
- Results stored in local state array
- Thumbnail gallery renders below scanner
- Modal reused for both new and historical results

## Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: No need to restart scanner for each QR code
2. **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple credentials in one session
3. **Visual Feedback**: Easy to see scan progress and status
4. **Review Capability**: Quick access to all scan results
5. **Better UX**: Similar to photo app gallery interface

## Error Handling
- Invalid QR codes don't close the scanner
- Network errors allow retry without restart
- Verification failures are tracked but don't interrupt flow

## Storage
- All verification results are stored using WorkerCacheService
- Results persist in local storage for offline access
- Session data cleared when modal closes
